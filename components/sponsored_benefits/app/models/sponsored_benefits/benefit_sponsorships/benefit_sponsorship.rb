# Manage enrollment-related behavior for a benefit-sponsoring organization (e.g. employers, congress, HBX, etc.)
# The model design assumes a once annual enrollment period and effective date.  For scenarios where there's a once-yearly
# open enrollment, new sponsors may join mid-year for initial enrollment, subsequently renewing on-schedule in following
# cycles.  Scenarios where enollments are conducted on a rolling monthly basis are also supported.

# OrganzationProfiles will typically embed many BenefitSponsorships.  A new BenefitSponsorship is in order when
# a significant change occurs, such as the following supported scenarios:
# - Benefit Sponsor (employer) terminates and later returns after some elapsed period
# - Existing Benefit Sponsor changes effective date

# Referencing a new BenefitSponsorship helps ensure integrity on subclassed and associated data models and
# enables history tracking as part of the models structure
