# BenefitSponsorship
# Manage benfit enrollment activity for a sponsoring Organization's Profile (e.g. EmployerProfile,
# HbxProfile, etc.) Behavior is goverened by settings obtained from the BenefitMarkets::BenefitCatelog.
# Typically assumes a once annual enrollment period and effective date.  For scenarios where there's a
# once-yearly open enrollment, new sponsors may join mid-year for initial enrollment, subsequently
# renewing on-schedule in following cycles. Scenarios where enollments are conducted on a rolling monthly
# basis are also supported.

# Organzations may embed many BenefitSponsorships.  Significant changes result in new BenefitSponsorship,
# such as the following supported scenarios:
# - Benefit Sponsor (employer) voluntarily terminates and later returns after some elapsed period
# - Benefit Sponsor is involuntarily terminated (such as for non-payment) and later becomes eligible
# - Existing Benefit Sponsor changes effective date

# Referencing a new BenefitSponsorship helps ensure integrity on subclassed and associated data models and
# enables history tracking as part of the models structure
