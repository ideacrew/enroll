  value: '"• Please enter the Card Number. The Card Number is exactly 13 letters and
    numbers. You must enter three letters followed by 10 numbers. You may not enter
    any special characters. • If you have a Resident Alien Card issued prior to December
    1997, it does not contain a Card Number. In that case please enter three ‘A’s
    followed by 10 zeroes (i.e., ''AAA0000000000'') so that you enter exactly 13 characters.   How
    to find the Card Number: The document number, also called a Card Number, is printed
    on the back of the current version of the card. Previous versions of the card
    featured the document number and expiration date on the front of the card."'
