  value: '"A POS (Point-of-Service) plan is a combination of an HMO and a PPO. Typically
    it has a network that functions like an HMO â€“ you pick a primary care doctor,
    who manages and coordinates your care within the network. Similar to a PPO, POS
    plans usually also allow you to use a provider who is not in the network."'
