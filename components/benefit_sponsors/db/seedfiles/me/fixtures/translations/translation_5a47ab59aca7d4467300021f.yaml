  value: '"An HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) plan usually only covers care
    from in-network providers. It generally won''t cover out-of-network care except
    in an emergency, and may require you to live or work in its service area to be
    eligible for coverage. You may be required to choose a primary care doctor."'
