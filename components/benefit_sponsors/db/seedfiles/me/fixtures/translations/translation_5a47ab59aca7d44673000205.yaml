  value: '"Each health insurance company offers a standard plan at each metal level.
    Benefits and cost-sharing are the same among standard plans of the same metal
    level, but monthly premiums and provider network options may be different. This
    makes it easier for consumers to compare plans at the same metal level and choose
    whatâ€™s best for them."'
