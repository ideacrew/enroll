# This rake task is to generate a list of enrollments satisfying the following scenario:
# Given a user has an active enrollment E1 with effective date X
# When the user purchases a new enrollment E2 with effective date Y
# And E2 is the same plan year
# And E2 is the same market type
# And E2 has the same subscriber
# E2 effective date > E1 effective date > E2 submitted on date.
# Then E1 is Canceled
