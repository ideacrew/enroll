require 'csv'
# This rake task generates a CSV report from a failure analysis of family to cv3 transformation. It creates a report
# where each row corresponds to a single family and has the following columns: hbx_assigned_id, result, and output. If a
# family's transformation fails, it logs the failure result or error message. The CSV report is saved in the root directory
# with the filename 'cv3_family_failures_report.csv'.
# Additionally, progress of the task and final report status are logged both to stdout and a log file 'cv3_family_failures_report.log'.
# The task supports continuing from where it left off by checking the last processed family id in 'cv3_report_last_processed_id.txt' or last failing family id in the CSV report file.
# @param
#   batch_size [Integer] the number of families to process in a single batch. Defaults to 100.
# @example
#   rake cv3_family_failures_report:generate_csv
