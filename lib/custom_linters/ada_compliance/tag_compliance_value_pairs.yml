# List so far
# Unique HTML attributes - "alt", "for", "id", "name", "placeholder", etc.
# Alt Text Presence - Images, logos, non text element

# Tables - Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables.
# - Descriptive labels - <input>, <textarea>, and <select> elements have descriptive labels.
