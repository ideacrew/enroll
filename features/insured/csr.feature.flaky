Feature: CSR finishes shopping for Individual

  @flaky
  Scenario: New insured user purchases on individual market
    Given Individual has not signed up as an HBX user
    When the FAA feature configuration is enabled
    When a CSR exists
    When Individual visits the Insured portal outside of open enrollment
    Then Individual creates a new HBX account
    Then I should see a successful sign up message
    And user should see your information page
    When user goes to register as an individual
    When user clicks on continue button
    Then user should see heading labeled personal information
    Then Individual should click on Individual market for plan shopping
    Then Individual should see a form to enter personal information
    When Individual clicks on Save and Exit
    Then Individual resumes enrollment
    And Individual click on Sign In
    And I signed in
    Then Individual sees previously saved address
    Then Individual asks for help
    Then Individual logs out
    Then Devops can verify session logs
    When CSR logs on to the HBX portal
    Then CSR should see the Agent Portal
    Then CSR should click on the Inbox tab
    Then CSR opens the most recent Please Contact Message
    Then CSR clicks on Resume Application via phone
    Then CSR agrees to the privacy agreeement
    Then CSR should see identity verification page and clicks on submit
    Then Individual should be on the Help Paying for Coverage page
    Then Individual does not apply for assistance and clicks continue
    Then CSR should see the dependents form
    And I click on the header link to return to CSR page
    Then CSR should see the Agent Portal

    # Then CSR clicks on New Consumer Paper Application
