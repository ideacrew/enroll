   Scenario Outline: As an HBX Staff with Super Admin subroles I should <action> force publish button based on <date_to_compare_with> and publish_due_day_of_month of benefit application
    Given that a user with a HBX staff role with Super Admin subrole exists and is logged in
    And the user is on the Employer Index of the Admin Dashboard
    And system date is between submission deadline & OE End date

    When the system date is <system_date_value> than the <date_to_compare_with>
    And the system date is <date_compare> than the publish_due_day_of_month
    And the user clicks Action for that Employer
    Then the user will <action> the Force Publish button

    Examples:
      | system_date_value  | date_to_compare_with                 | date_compare | action  |
      | greater            | earliest_start_prior_to_effective_on | less         | not see |
      | less               | monthly_open_enrollment_end_on       | greater      | see     |

  Scenario: Draft application published between submission deadline & application effective date
    Given that a user with a HBX staff role with Super Admin subrole exists and is logged in
    And the user is on the Employer Index of the Admin Dashboard
    And the system date is less than the earliest_start_prior_to_effective_on
