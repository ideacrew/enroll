Feature: Consumer requests enrollment in CoverAll
  As a person who is aware in advance that he is not qualified for QHP through the
  exchange, and has not initialized an application through EA, he can request to
  be enrolled in CoverAll. The HBX admin can then enter their information and
  process their application through the families index page.
