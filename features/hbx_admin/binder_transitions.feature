Feature: Binder transitions
  As an HBX admin I can help employers pay for their insurance.

  Background:
    Given a new employer, with insured employees, exists
    And an HBX admin exists
    And the HBX admin is logged in

  Scenario: HBX-Admin participation requirements checklist for new ER
    Given the HBX admin visits the Dashboard page
    And the HBX admin clicks on the Binder Transition tab
    Then the HBX admin sees a checklist
      | checklist                                                              |
      | Minimum participation: ≥ 0.66 * (All enrolled + waived / All Eligible) |
      | At least one non-owner or owner family member must enroll (at renewal) |
      | Owner/owner family member flag: Can be self-attested                   |
      | Binder premium amount and payment status verified by HBX               |
    When the HBX admin selects the employer to confirm
    Then the initiate "Binder Paid" button will be active
    And the HBX admin clicks the "Binder Paid" button
    Then then the Employer’s state transitions to "Binder Paid"

  Scenario: HBX-Admin confirms participation requirements for new ER
    Given the employer meets requirements
    Given the HBX admin has confirmed requirements for the employer
    When the employer remits initial binder payment
    And the DCHBX confirms binder payment has been received by third-party processor
    And the HBX admin has verified new (initial) Employer meets minimum participation requirements (2/3 rule)
    And a sufficient number of 'non-owner' employee(s) have enrolled and/or waived in Employer-sponsored benefits
    Then the initiate "Binder Paid" button will be active

  Scenario: HBX-Admin changes Employer state to Binder Paid for new ER

    And the HBX admin has confirmed requirements for the employer
    And the employer has remitted the initial binder payment

    And the HBX admin clicks the "Binder Paid" button
    Then then the Employer’s state transitions to "Binder Paid"
    And the Group XML is generated for the Employer
