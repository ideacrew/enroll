The sections on the left contain a breakdown of all you need to know about the Enroll App, from the various engines housed within Enroll to the data models and a basic walkthrough of the User Interface.

We will continuously update the documentation for Enroll and include both a high level overview of the models and essential files for devs as well integrating more build artifacts.

Ruby API documentation for Enroll can be viewed [here](/yard).
