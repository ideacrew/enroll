  # Ensure that a primary broker has a broker staff role when the broker role
  # is 'activated'.
  #
  # There are multiple ways for broker roles to be 'activated':
  #
  # * acceptance of a broker role invitation when no other roles exist on that
  #   person
  # * approval of a broker role for a person who already has a consumer role
  # * successfully linking a person who already has a broker role via broker
  #   application approval
  #
  # Each of these have different rules for when and which roles we should
  # create, which states the staff role should transition through, and
  # if the agency needs some form of broker agency application manipulated.
  #
  # This class is designed to encapsulate all these different entry points and
  # present a common location for manipulation of these roles.  It is not
  # designed to solve the problem that we invoke this in multiple areas - only
  # to provide a single place for the logic until we can perform a more
  # comprehensive refactor of the behaviour.
