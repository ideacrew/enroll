    # This class is invoked when we want to generate a passive renewal for an active enrollment.
    # It will validate the incoming enrollment if it can be renewed and calls a different class
    # to generate the renewal enrollment.
    # It will renew HbxEnrollments that are effectuated(by aasm state).
    # It will renew an HbxEnrollment with a retroactive effective date.
    # It will renew an HbxEnrollment for an effective date that's not first day of month.
    # It will renew both health and dental enrollments.

    # For assisted renewals:
    # It will fetch eligibility values from the DB for renewing enrollment.
    # The applied aptc is sum of member aptcs calculated based on the new enrollment members(covers HbxEnrollmentMembers change).
    # If none of the HbxEnrollmentMembers are eligible for APTC, then no aptc will be applied on to the HbxEnrollment.
    # If any enrollment member who is child/ward/foster_child/adopted_child to primary and is aged equal or above 26,
    # then the member will be dropped from the renewal enrollment. Also, the renewal enrollment will be in 'coverage_selected' state.
    # Case where ehb_premium is less than the selected aptc, then the aptc equals to ehb_premium will be applied on to enrollment.
    # Case where ehb_premium is greater than the selected aptc, then the selected aptc will be applied on to enrollment.
    # Case where one of the enrollment members are not is_ia_eligible, then the renewal_product will be selected and not a CSR product.
    # The default aptc to be applied on to the enrollment is 85% of applicable aptc for the cases where current enrollment is not assisted.
    # If the current enrollment is assisted(has applied aptc), then the same percentage of aptc will be applied to the renewing enrollment.
