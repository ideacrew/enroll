# A model for grouping and organizing a {Person} with their related {FamilyMember FamilyMember(s)},
# benefit enrollment eligibility, financial assistance eligibility and availability, benefit enrollments,
# broker agents, and documents.
#
# Each family has one or more {FamilyMember FamilyMembers}, each associated with a {Person} instance.  Each
# Family has exactly one FamilyMember designated as the {#primary_applicant}. A Person can belong to
# more than one Family, but may be the primary_applicant of only one active Family.
#
# Family is a top level physical MongoDB Collection.
