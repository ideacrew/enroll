  <b> What is New Hire Open Enrollment? </b>
  <br/>
  New Hire Open Enrollment is a one-time opportunity to enroll in health plans offered by your new employer based on your status as a new employee. After this one-time new hire open enrollment, you will have an annual open enrollment period where you will have the opportunity to make plan changes or drop coverage.  Outside of this open enrollment period, you will only be allowed to make changes to your enrollment if you experience certain qualifying life events (QLE) such as marriage, birth, adoption, or other qualifying events.

  <i>Note</i>: If you have other insurance coverage and do not wish to enroll into the plan(s) offered to you by <%= census_employee.employer_profile.legal_name %> at this time, you must still apply to “waive” coverage. Doing so preserves your right to enroll in your employer-sponsored health insurance through a special enrollment period (SEP), if you qualify, at a later date this year. Instructions for how to waive coverage are included in <a href="https://dchealthlink.com/sites/default/files/v2/forms/Employees-How-to-Enroll-in-a-Plan-through-DC-Health-Link.pdf">this walkthrough guide</a>.
