Congratulations! <%= census_employee.employer_profile.legal_name %> has invited you to sign up for employer-sponsored health insurance through <%= Settings.site.short_name %> and will contribute to the monthly premium to make the cost of coverage more affordable.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  You are able to begin plan shopping on <%= census_employee.hired_on.to_formatted_s %> for coverage that will start on <%= census_employee.coverage_effective_on.to_date.to_formatted_s %> as part of your new hire open enrollment period. To enroll into employer-sponsored insurance through <%= Settings.site.short_name %>, you must complete your application by <%= census_employee.new_hire_enrollment_period.last.to_date.to_formatted_s %>.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b> What is New Hire Open Enrollment? </b>
  <br/>
  New Hire Open Enrollment is a one-time opportunity to enroll in health plans offered by your new employer based on your status as a new employee.   After this one-time new hire open enrollment, you will have an annual open enrollment period where you will have the opportunity to make plan changes or drop coverage.  Outside of this open enrollment period, you will only be allowed to make changes to your enrollment if you experience certain qualifying life events (QLE) such as marriage, birth, adoption, or other qualifying events.
  <br/>

  <i>Note</i>: If you have other insurance coverage and do not wish to enroll into the plan(s) offered to you by <%= census_employee.employer_profile.legal_name %> at this time, you must still apply to “waive” coverage. Doing so preserves your right to enroll in your employer-sponsored health insurance through a special enrollment period (SEP), if you qualify, at a later date this year. Instructions for how to waive coverage are included in <a href="https://dchealthlink.com/sites/default/files/v2/forms/Employees-How-to-Enroll-in-a-Plan-through-DC-Health-Link.pdf">this walkthrough guide</a>.

  <b>What If I Already Have Coverage through <%= Settings.site.short_name %>?</b>
  If you currently have individual market coverage through <%= Settings.site.short_name %> and would like to terminate that coverage when you enroll in your employer-sponsored health coverage with <%= Settings.site.short_name %>, you will need to contact <%= Settings.site.short_name %> at <%= Settings.contact_center.phone_number %>.  To end individual market coverage through <%= Settings.site.short_name %>, you need to submit a request to terminate your plan.
