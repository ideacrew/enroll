  <b> What is New Hire Open Enrollment? </b>
  <br/>
  New Hire Open Enrollment is a one-time opportunity to enroll in health plans offered by your new employer based on your status as a new employee.   After this one-time new hire open enrollment, you will have an annual open enrollment period where you will have the opportunity to make plan changes or drop coverage.  Outside of this open enrollment period, you will only be allowed to make changes to your enrollment if you experience certain qualifying life events (QLE) such as marriage, birth, adoption, or other qualifying events.
  <br/>
  <b>To See Plan Options and Enroll: </b>
  <br/>
  To complete the application process, please follow the steps below. You can also use our <b>Employee guide to enrolling</b> for help with this process. You can find this guide in our online <%= link_to_site_business_resource_center %>.

  <b>What If I Already Have Coverage through the <%= site_short_name %>?</b>
