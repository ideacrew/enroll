    What is Open Enrollment?
  </b>
  <br/>
    Open enrollment is your annual opportunity to enroll in plans offered by your employer.  Outside of this open enrollment period, you will only be allowed to make changes to your enrollment if you experience certain qualifying life events (QLE) such as marriage, birth, adoption, or other qualifying events.
