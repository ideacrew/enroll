      We will keep your information private and will not share it with anyone unless you allow it or it is required by law. Your answers will only be used to decide whether you are eligible for health insurance. Information about your health will not be
      used to deny you insurance or determine how much you pay.
      <br/><br/>
      You can complete an application for health insurance for your children or other family members even if you do not qualify yourself. If you are applying for benefits for other members of your family, you will need to give us information about where
      you live, but you are not required to answer any questions about your citizenship or immigration status and you will not have to give us a Social Security Number.
      <br/><br/>
      As part of the application process, we will be checking the information you give us with information from other government agencies like the Social Security Administration, and the Department of Homeland Security. If the information you provide does
      not match the information we get from these agencies, we may ask you to send us proof. Remember, if you are not applying for benefits for yourself, we will not ask you about your citizenship or immigration status and will not check your information
      with the Department of Homeland Security.

      By selecting CONTINUE, you are saying that you understand that information in this application, and the information we get from data sources will be used to decide the eligibility of the people who are applying for health insurance. You are also
      indicating that you have permission from all of the people listed on the application for their information to be retrieved and used from data sources.
